Market capitalisation is the share price of a company multiplied by the number of shares issued.\nThe Fund uses optimising techniques to achieve a similar return to the Index. These may include the strategic selection of certain securities that make up the Index or \nother securities which provide similar performance to certain constituent securities. These may also include the use of financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. \ninvestments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets). FDIs may be used for direct investment purposes. The investment manager may use \nFDIs to help achieve the Fund’s investment objective.\nThe Fund may also engage in short-term secured lending of its investments to certain eligible third parties to generate additional income to off-set the costs of the \nFund.\nRecommendation: This Fund is suitable for medium to long term investment, though the Fund may also be suitable for shorter term exposure to the Index.\nYour shares will be accumulating shares (i.e. income will be included in their value).\nYour shares will be denominated in US Dollar, the Fund's base currency.\nThe shares are listed on one or more stock exchanges and may be traded in currencies other than their base currency. The performance of your shares may be \naffected by this currency difference. In normal circumstances, only authorised participants (e.g. select financial institutions) may deal in shares (or interests in shares) \ndirectly with the Fund.

These factors may impact the value of the Share Class or \nexpose the Share Class to losses.\n- Shares in smaller companies typically trade in less volume and experience \ngreater price variations than larger companies.\n- Investment risk is concentrated in specific sectors, countries, currencies or \ncompanies. This means the Fund is more sensitive to any localised economic, \nmarket, political, sustainability-related or regulatory events.\n- The value of equities and equity-related securities can be affected by daily \nstock market movements.

These companies must maintain a developed market listing for their shares, and meet minimum market capitalisation and \nliquidity requirements to be considered for inclusion in the Index. Companies are included in the Index on a free float-adjusted market capitalisation weighted basis. \nFree float-adjusted means that only shares available to investors rather than all of a company’s issued shares are used in calculating the Index, and exclude shares \nclosely held by control groups, other publicly traded companies or government agencies. Market capitalisation is the share price of a company multiplied by the \nnumber of shares issued. Shares that are liquid mean that they can easily be bought and sold in normal market conditions. The maximum weighting of each \nconstituent in the Index is capped at 10% at each rebalance. Therefore, in between Index rebalances, the weighting of any constituent could exceed 10% of the Index.\nThe Fund intends to replicate the Index by holding the equity securities, which make up the Index, in similar proportions to it.\nThe Fund may also engage in short-term secured lending of its investments to certain eligible third parties to generate additional income to off-set the costs of the \nFund.\nThe investment manager may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on, one or more underlying assets) to help \nachieve the Fund’s investment objective.

The information is required by law to\nhelp you understand the nature and the risks of investing in this fund. You are advised to read it so you can make an informed decision\nabout whether to invest. Terms not defined herein are as defined in the Prospectus.\nSPDR MSCI USA Small Cap Value Weighted UCITS ETF\n(the \"Fund\"), a sub-fund of SSGA SPDR ETFs Europe II plc. This Fund is managed by State Street Global\nAdvisors Europe Limited, part of the State Street Corporation.\nShare Class: Dist (ISIN IE00BSPLC413)\nObjectives and Investment Policy\nInvestment Objective The investment objective of the Fund is to track\nthe performance of US small capitalisation equities with a higher\nweighting applied to equities exhibiting low valuation characteristics.\nInvestment Policy The Fund seeks to track the performance of the\nMSCI USA Small Cap Value Weighted Index (the \"Index\") as closely as\npossible.\nThe Fund is an index tracking fund (also known as a passively managed\nfund).\nThe Fund invests primarily in securities included in the Index. These\nsecurities include US smaller sized companies based on the traditional\nmarket capitalisation weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Small Cap\nIndex. The value methodology re-weights each security in the parent\nindex to emphasise stocks with lower valuations using fundamental\naccounting data (sales, book value, earnings and cash earnings). As it\nmay be difficult to purchase all securities in the Index efficiently, in\nseeking to track the performance of the Index, the Fund will use an\noptimisation strategy to build a representative portfolio which should\nreflect the performance of the Index. Consequently, the Fund will\ntypically hold only a subset of the securities included in the Index. In\nlimited circumstances the Fund may purchase securities that are not\nincluded in the Index.\nThe Fund may use financial derivative instruments (that is, financial\ncontracts whose prices are dependent on one or more underlying\nassets) in order to manage the portfolio efficiently.\nSave in exceptional circumstances, the Fund will generally only issue\nand redeem shares to certain institutional investors. However, shares of\nthe Fund may be purchased or sold through brokers on one or more\nstock exchanges. The Fund trades on these stock exchanges at market\nprices which may fluctuate throughout the day. Market prices may be\ngreater or less than the daily net asset value of the Fund.\nThe Fund's maximum exposure to securities lending as a percentage of\nits Net Asset Value will not exceed 40%.\nShareholders may redeem shares on any UK business day (other than\ndays on which relevant financial markets are closed for business and/or\nthe day preceding any such day provided that a list of such closed\nmarket days will be published for the Fund on www.ssga.com); and any\nother day at the Directors' discretion (acting reasonably) provided\nShareholders are notified in advance of any such days.\nAny income earned by the Fund will be retained and reflected in an\nincrease in the value of the shares.\nThe Shares of the USD Class are issued in U.S. Dollar.\nPlease refer to the Prospectus for more information.\nIndex Source: The funds or securities referred to herein are not\nsponsored, endorsed, or promoted by MSCI, and MSCI bears no liability\nwith respect to any such funds or securities or any index on which such\nfunds or securities are based. The prospectus and supplement contains\na more detailed description of the limited relationship MSCI has with\nState Street Bank and Trust Company, through SSGA, and related\nfunds, as well as additional disclaimers that apply to the MSCI indexes.\nThe MSCI indexes are the exclusive property of MSCI and may not be\nreproduced or extracted and used for any other purpose without MSCI's\nconsent. The MSCI indexes are provided without any warranties of any\nkind.\nRisk and Reward Profile\nLower risk\nHigher risk\nPotentially lower reward\nPotentially higher reward\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nRisk Disclaimer The risk category above is not a measure of capital\nloss or gains but of how significant the rises and falls in the Fund's return\nhave been historically.\nFor example a fund whose return has experienced significant rises and\nfalls will be in a higher risk category, whereas a fund whose return has\nexperienced less significant rises and falls will be in a lower risk\ncategory.\nThe lowest category (i.e., category 1) does not mean that a fund is a risk\nfree investment.\nAs the Fund's risk category has been calculated using historical data, it\nmay not be a reliable indication of the Fund's future risk profile.\nThe Fund's risk category shown is not guaranteed and may change in\nthe future.\nWhy is this Fund in this category? The Fund is in risk category 7 as\nits return has experienced very high rises and falls historically.\nThe following are material risks relevant to the Fund which are not\nadequately captured by the risk category.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular way, the issues affecting the investments will have a greater\neffect than if the Fund was more diversified. This concentration may also\nlimit the Fund's liquidity.\nIndex Tracking Risk: The Fund's performance may not exactly track\nthe Index. This can result from market fluctuations, changes in the\ncomposition of the Index, transaction costs, the costs of making changes\nto the Fund's portfolio and other Fund expenses.\nLiquidity Risk & ETF Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market or resale\nrestrictions may limit the Fund's ability to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid securities may trade at a\ndiscount and may affect the ability to meet redemptions on a timely\nbasis. Where the Fund invests in illiquid securities or does not trade in\nlarge volumes, the bid offer spreads may widen, the Fund may be\nexposed to increased valuation risk and reduced ability to trade. Shares\nin the Fund may also trade at prices materially different to the last\navailable NAV.\nSmaller Companies Risk: Small companies' securities may be more\nvolatile and trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than those of\nlarger companies. These companies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets or financial resources, may lack competitive strength and may\ndepend on a few key employees. Smaller companies may have limited or\nno track record of success.\nPlease refer to the Prospectus for full details about the risks associated\nwith this Fund.\nKey Investor Information\n\nCharges\nThe charges you pay are used to pay the cost of running the Fund,\nincluding the costs of marketing and distributing it.

INVESTMENT POLICY: To achieve the \naim, the fund will attempt to replicate the index, before fees and \nexpenses, by buying a portfolio of securities that may comprise the \nconstituents of the index or other unrelated investments as \ndetermined by DWS entities. The fund may employ techniques and \ninstruments in order to manage risk, reduce costs and improve \nresults. These techniques and instruments may include the use of \nderivatives. The fund may also engage in secured lending of its \ninvestments to certain eligible third parties to generate additional \nincome to offset the costs of the fund. FURTHER INFORMATION: \nCertain information (including the latest share prices of the fund, \nindicative net asset values, full disclosure on the composition of the \nfund's portfolio and information on the index constituents) are \navailable on your local DWS website or at www.Xtrackers.com. \nTransaction costs and taxes,  unexpected fund costs and market \nconditions such as volatility or liquidity issues may affect the ability \nof the fund to track the index.  The anticipated level of tracking error \nin normal market conditions is 1 per cent. The currency of the fund \nis USD.  Returns and gains are not distributed but are reinvested in \nthe fund.  You may request the redemption of shares generally on a \ndaily basis.\nRisk and reward profile\nLower risk\nHigher risk\nPotentially lower reward\nPotentially higher reward\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe calculation of the risk and reward profile is based on historical \ndata that cannot be used as a reliable indicator for the future risk \nprofile. This risk indicator is subject to changes; the classification of \nthe fund may change over time and cannot be guaranteed. Even a \nfund that is classified in the lowest category (category 1) does not \nrepresent a completely risk-free investment. The fund is classified \nin category 6 because its share price may fluctuate strongly and \nthe likelihood of both losses and gains may therefore be high.  The \nfollowing risks could be of particular significance for the fund: The \nfund will attempt to replicate the performance of the index less \ncosts, but your investment is not expected to match the \nperformance \nof \nthe \nindex \nprecisely. \nEXCEPTIONAL \nCIRCUMSTANCES RISK: Exceptional circumstances may arise, \nsuch as, but not limited to, disruptive market conditions, additional \ncosts/taxes or extremely volatile markets, which may cause the \nfund's performance to be substantially different from the \nperformance of the index. NO GUARANTEE RISK: The fund is not \nguaranteed and your investment is at risk. The value of your \ninvestment may go down as well as up. CONFLICTS OF \nINTEREST RISK: DWS entities and related companies may act in \nseveral roles in relation to the fund such as distributor and \nmanagement company which may involve conflicts of interest. \nEMERGING MARKETS RISK: The fund is exposed to less \neconomically developed economies (known as emerging markets) \nwhich involve greater risks than well developed economies. \nPolitical unrest and economic downturn may be more likely and will \naffect the value of your investment. Settlement of buy or sell \ntransactions for the fund may be delayed and there may be \nuncertainty about the ownership of the fund’s investments. The \ncustodian may not in certain circumstances be liable to the fund for \nits acts and omissions or those to whom it delegates custody of the \nfund’s investments. RULES BASED INDEX RISK: The index is \nrules-based and is not capable of being adjusted to take into \naccount changing market circumstances. As a result you may be \nnegatively affected by, or may not benefit from, the lack of such \nadjustments \nin \nchanging \nmarket \ncircumstances. \nDISRUPTIONS/ADJUSTMENT EVENTS RISK: The index may \nalso be subject to disruption or adjustment events which may \nprevent its calculation or lead to adjustments to the rules of the \nindex which may cause your investment to suffer losses. TAX \nRISK: The fund may invest in jurisdictions where the tax regime is \nnot fully developed or is not sufficiently certain, and as such \nchanges to the tax policies may be implemented without any prior \nnotice and may also apply retrospectively. Any changes in tax \npolicies may reduce the after-taxation returns of the constituents to \nwhich the performance of the fund is linked. RESTRICTED \nMARKETS RISK: The fund may invest in securities in respect of \nwhich the local government imposes limitations or restrictions on \nforeign ownership or holdings. Such legal and regulatory \nrestrictions or limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity \nand performance of the fund holdings as compared to the \nperformance of the Reference index. This may increase the risk of \ntracking error and, at the worst, the fund may not be able to \nachieve its investment objective and/or the fund may have to be \nclosed to further subscriptions. DERIVATIVES RISK: The fund may \nuse derivatives to try to manage its investments more efficiently. \nThis may not always be successful and may result in greater \nfluctuations in the value of the fund. This may negatively affect the \nvalue of the fund and your investment. \nA more detailed description of risks and other general information \ncan be found in the risk section(s) of the prospectus. \nCharges\nThe charges you pay are used to pay the costs of running the fund, including the costs of marketing and distributing it.

The fund may also engage in \nsecured lending of its investments to certain eligible third parties to \ngenerate additional income to offset the costs of the fund. \nFURTHER INFORMATION: Certain information (including the latest \nshare prices of the fund, indicative net asset values, full disclosure \non the composition of the fund's portfolio and information on the \nindex constituents) are available on your local DWS website or at \nwww.Xtrackers.com. Transaction costs and taxes, unexpected fund \ncosts and market conditions such as volatility or liquidity issues may \naffect the ability of the fund to track the index. The anticipated level \nof tracking error in normal market conditions is 1 per cent. The \ncurrency of the fund is USD.  Returns and gains are not distributed \nbut are reinvested in the fund.  You may request the redemption of \nshares generally on a daily basis.\nRisk and reward profile\nLower risk\nHigher risk\nPotentially lower reward\nPotentially higher reward\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe calculation of the risk and reward profile is based on historical \ndata that cannot be used as a reliable indicator for the future risk \nprofile. This risk indicator is subject to changes; the classification of \nthe fund may change over time and cannot be guaranteed. Even a \nfund that is classified in the lowest category (category 1) does not \nrepresent a completely risk-free investment. The fund is classified \nin category 6 because its share price may fluctuate strongly and \nthe likelihood of both losses and gains may therefore be high.  The \nfollowing risks could be of particular significance for the fund: The \nfund will attempt to replicate the performance of the index less \ncosts, but your investment is not expected to match the \nperformance \nof \nthe \nindex \nprecisely. \nEXCEPTIONAL \nCIRCUMSTANCES RISK: Exceptional circumstances may arise, \nsuch as, but not limited to, disruptive market conditions, additional \ncosts/taxes or extremely volatile markets, which may cause the \nfund's performance to be substantially different from the \nperformance of the index. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK: DWS \nentities and related companies may act in several roles in relation \nto the fund such as distributor and management company which \nmay involve conflicts of interest. NO GUARANTEE RISK: The fund \nis not guaranteed and your investment is at risk. The value of your \ninvestment may go down as well as up. SHARES RISK: The value \nof an investment in shares will depend on a number of factors \nincluding, but not limited to, market and economic conditions, \nsector, geographical region and political events. RULES BASED \nINDEX RISK: The index is rules-based and is not capable of being \nadjusted to take into account changing market circumstances. As a \nresult you may be negatively affected by, or may not benefit from, \nthe lack of such adjustments in changing market circumstances. \nDERIVATIVES RISK: The fund may use derivatives to try to \nmanage its investments more efficiently. This may not always be \nsuccessful and may result in greater fluctuations in the value of the \nfund. This may negatively affect the value of the fund and your \ninvestment. \nA more detailed description of risks and other general information \ncan be found in the risk section(s) of the prospectus. \nCharges\nThe charges you pay are used to pay the costs of running the fund, including the costs of marketing and distributing it. These charges \nreduce the potential growth of your investment.\nOne-off charges taken before or after you invest\nEntry charge\nNone\nExit charge\nNone\nThis is the maximum that might be taken out of your money before it is \ninvested (entry charge) and before the proceeds of your investment are paid \nout (exit charge).\nCharges taken from the fund over a year\nOngoing charges\n0.20 %\nCharges taken from the fund under certain specific conditions\nPerformance fee\nNone\nSecurities lending fees\n0.00 %\nSecondary market investors (those who buy or sell shares \non a stock exchange) may be charged certain fees by their \nstock broker. These charges, if any, can be obtained from \nsuch stock broker. Authorised participants dealing directly \nwith the fund will pay the transaction costs related to their \nsubscriptions and redemptions. \nThe ongoing charges figure is based on expenses for the \nfiscal year ending 31.12.2023. It may vary from year to \nyear. \nIt \nexcludes \nportfolio \ntransaction \ncosts \nand \nperformance fees, if any. \nAdditional information on costs can be found in the cost \nsection(s) of the prospectus. \nTo the extent the fund undertakes securities lending to generate revenue, the fund will ultimately be allocated 82% of the associated \nrevenue, the securities lending agent, which will be a Deutsche Bank entity, will be allocated 9% and the remaining 9% will be allocated to \nthe DWS entity which monitors such activities, as set out in the sales prospectus and/or supplement, for its own coordination and oversight \ntasks. As securities lending revenue sharing does not increase the costs of running the fund, this has been excluded from the composition of \ncosts.\n\nPast performance\naaa\nPast performance is not a reliable \nindicator of future performance. All costs \nand fees that were withdrawn from the 1C \nshare class of Xtrackers S&P 500 Equal \nWeight UCITS ETF were deducted during \nthe calculation.
